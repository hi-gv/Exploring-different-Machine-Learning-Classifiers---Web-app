# Exploring different Machine Learning Classifiers - Web App

Using 'Streamlit' library, a web app is created to explore 3 different Classification algorithms - KNN, SVM & Random Forest with 'SKlearn' package.
User can tweak the main parameters and check the shape & accuracy of the classification models in real time on the 
classic datasets of Iris, Breast Cancer & Wine datasets
